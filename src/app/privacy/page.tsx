                Spotify was created as an open-source app that utilizes the Spotify/Last.fm/Apple Music Web API. By using this app, you consent to the use of your Spotify account username and data to display your top artists.

                Sonatra does not store or collect any data, nor does it share your information with third parties. All data is used exclusively for generating your personality description.

                While you can be confident that your data is neither stored nor misused, you can revoke Sonatra access through the apps page and click &quot;REMOVE ACCESS&quot; for Sonatra.

                I use the official Spotify API so I do not collect any data from your account authentication, means I am just connecting you to the Spotify official data. I generate the description using ChatGPT API. There is nothing you should worry about, your data is safe.
